# Implementação de DoublyLinkedList em C++ com RawPointers | DoublyLinkedList implementation in C++ with RawPointers

A C++ implementation of a Doubly Linked List using Raw Pointers. Each node contains a value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node, allowing traversal of the list in both directions. 

- Efficient insertion and removal at any position 
- Bidirectional traversal (forward and backward) 
- Manual memory management without smart pointers 
- Flexible structure without external dependencies
